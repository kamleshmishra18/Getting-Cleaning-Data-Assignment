  1. Download the ZIP file from the assignment Page.
  2. UNZIP the file to the Directory whereever you want
  3. Check the files provided (optional)
  4. Files/Folders included for this assignment are:
    a. 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
    b. 'features.txt': List of all features.
    c. 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
    d. 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
    e. 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
    f. 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
    g. 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
    h. 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
    i. 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
    j. 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
    k. 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
